# Pomodoro Timer

The main objective of this project was to learn how to use React hooks such as useEffect and useState. As this application has many shared pieces of state that must be updated and maintained over a period of time using a timer. The application allows the user to select two time lengths - a session of productivity and a break period. These two periods then alternate when the user presses the play button. Once a timer reaches zero a short audio clip plays to announce that the timer is finished before it switches to either a break or another session.
